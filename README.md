# DevHack22
_A Hackathon organised by the DevIncept Community_

Hello everyone, this side Abhishek Sharma, a pre-final year student of University of Engineering and Management, Kolkata, currently pursuing my B.Tech degree in Computer Science and Engineering major. I have participated in this competition without any expectation, but wanted to gain an experience to hack toughest hackathons all around the world. I'm basically comfortable with Machine Learning domain, and DevHack22 also provided me the opportunity to express myself over here. I solved the problem statement, using a machine learning approach and provided the highest accuracy with the dataset for the `test` set and `predicted` set. 

### 🔴 What was my approach?
Initially whenever I go for solving any problem statement I look into different aspects rather than solving directly from the scratch.
1. Look into the problem statement carefully, to understand what actually they wanted from me!
2. Set a roadmap and goal for the solution.
3. Work according to the roadmap set by me for the problem statement.
4. Now in case  of machine learning and data analysis you need to work around with the dataset given to you, for that I follow these procedures.
    >- Check out the attributes of the dataset.
    >- Finding out the best corelation for creating the model.
    >- Data Analysis part for the visualization of the data.
    >- Try out several algorithms to find out the best accuracy.
    >- Finalize the model and create the `.pkl` by dumping the model with the finalized algorithm.
5. Conclude the session and present the model properly.
6. Share the solution in YouTube for better engagement with the community.
